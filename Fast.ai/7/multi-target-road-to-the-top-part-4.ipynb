After all, doesn't that mean that the model has *more* to do? Mightn't it get rather distracted from its main task, which is to identify paddy disease?\n\nPerhaps... But in previous projects I've often found the opposite to be true, especially when training for quite a few epochs. By giving the model more signal about what is present in a picture, it may be able to use this information to find more interesting features that predict our target of interest. For instance, perhaps some of the features of disease change between varieties.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Multi-output `DataLoader`","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"First we'll repeat the steps we used last time to access the data and ensure all the latest libraries are installed:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"comp = 'paddy-disease-classification'\npath = setup_comp(comp, install='fastai \"timm>=0.6.2.dev0\"')\nfrom fastai.vision.all import *\nset_seed(42)\n\nfrom fastcore.parallel import *\ntrn_path = path/'train_images'","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":false,"_kg_hide-output":true,"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2022-06-19T01:46:41.170305Z","iopub.status.busy":"2022-06-19T01:46:41.168094Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-06-19T01:47:01.1477Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-06-19T01:47:01.146587Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-06-19T01:46:41.170255Z"}},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Here's the CSV that Kaggle provides, showing the variety of rice contained in each image -- we'll make `image_id` the index of our data frame so that we can look up images directly to grab their variety:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df = pd.read_csv(path/'train.csv', index_col='image_id')\ndf.head()","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Pandas uses the `loc` attribute to look up rows by index.

But as to whether it's going to help us better predict rice disease, I honestly don't know. I haven't come across any research that tackles this important question: when can a multi-target model improve the accuracy of the individual targets compared to a single target model? (That doesn't mean it doesn't exist of course -- perhaps it does and I haven't found it yet...)\n\nI've certainly found in previous projects that there are cases where improvements to single targets can be made by using a multi-target model. I'd guess that it'll be most useful when you're having problems with overfitting. So try doing this with more epochs, and let me know how you go!\n\nIf you found this notebook useful, please remember to click the little up-arrow at the top to upvote it, since I like to know when people have found my work useful, and it helps others find it too.
