# Project Instructions

Automate product tagging for the e-commerce store using CNNs.

Once trained (keeping the epochs to 1 or 2 to keep the run time down), store your predictions on the test set in a list named predictions.

Calculate the accuracy, and per-class precision and recall for your classifier based on the predictions obtained. Store your metrics in variables named accuracy, precision, and recall. Use lists of the appropriate length for the precision and recall.
